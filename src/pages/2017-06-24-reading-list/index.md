1. [Modern Romance by Aziz Ansari and Eric Klinenberg](https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Romance-Aziz-Ansari/dp/0143109251) - Great book, highlighy recommend the audiobook

2. [Start With Why by Simon Sinek](https://startwithwhy.com/) - did not finish. Too repetitive

3. [Fresh off the Boat: A Memoir by Eddie Huang](https://www.amazon.com/Fresh-Off-Boat-Eddie-Huang/dp/0812983351) - hilarious. Easily one of my favorite books of 2017

4. [What I Know For Sure by Oprah Winfrey](https://www.amazon.com/What-Know-Sure-Oprah-Winfrey/dp/1250054052) - It's Oprah. You gotta love it. 

5. [Eat Move Sleep by Tom Rath](http://www.eatmovesleep.org/book/) - some interesting advice here; tbh, I don't remember a lot of it. 

6. [The Life Changing Magic of Not Giving a F*ck by Sarah Knight](https://www.amazon.com/Life-Changing-Magic-Not-Giving-Spending/dp/0316270725) - I remember nodding along with some of the stuff in this book. And also rolling my eyes at the author just as much.

7. [The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck by Mark Manson](https://www.amazon.com/Subtle-Art-Not-Giving-Counterintuitive/dp/0062457713) - I read #6 because I was waiting for this one to come in. Totally worth the read. Will probably re-read this and takes notes the next time around.  

8. [Good to Great by Jim Collins](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Great-Some-Companies-Others/dp/0066620996) - Someone put a hold on this one before I could finish it. The problem with books like this is they get outdated very quickly. A lot of the "great" companies mentioned in this book are now long gone, so it's hard to say what truly makes a "great" company. Because of this, I'm not super motivated to re-read or finish this one.

9. [I Remember Nothing by Nora Ephron](https://www.amazon.com/I-Remember-Nothing-Other-Reflections/dp/0307742806) - I read this after watching "Good Girls Revolt." There is an air of sadness with this one...you can hear it in her voice via the audiobook. That's the only thing I really remember about this one.

10. [You Are Badass by Jen Sincero](https://www.amazon.com/You-Are-Badass-Doubting-Greatness/dp/0762447699) - I've seen this book on so many "must read books for feminists/20-somethings/etc" and I don't know why. Time is better spent on #3, #4 & #7.

11. [The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho](https://www.amazon.com/Alchemist-Paulo-Coelho/dp/0061122416) - this one is all about mind-set. Don't read too into it. Take it as a "Disney"/"Alladin"/"Little Prince" sort of a journey. It's a simple, cute story. If you read too much into it, you will not like this book. You have been warned.  

12. [Outliers: The Story of Success by Malcolm Gladwell](https://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930) - this was a good one. Makes you wonder if you are one of the 'special ones.'

13. [Made to Stick by Dan & Chip Heath](https://www.amazon.com/Made-Stick-Ideas-Survive-Others/dp/1400064287) - this one ran onto the same problem as #2 & #8. It's a bit too repetitive, and some of the examples are outdated. Sticky Ideas are: 1. Simple 2. Concrete 3. Unexpected 4. Emotional 5. Tell a Story 6. Credible

14. [Revolution for Dummies: Laughing through the Arab Spring by Bassem Youssef](https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062446893/revolution-for-dummies) - ok. remember #10? This one is an excellent and probably more "Funducational" one. Learn about the before-during-and-after-the-Arab-Spring through the eyes of a heart surgeon turn "Jon Stewart of the Arab World," Bassem Youssef
