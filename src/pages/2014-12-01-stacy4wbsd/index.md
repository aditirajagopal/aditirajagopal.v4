Stacy Gold Brickman is one of my neighbors back home. She has played an active
role in the West Bloomfield School District over the years, and in 2014,
she decided to run for a highly contested position on the District Board.

Stacy ended up winning one of two seats on the School Board beating her opponents
with over [500 votes](http://www.theoaklandpress.com/article/OP/20141105/NEWS/141109805). 

## Logo

Stacy is passionate about the school district, and is always coming up with innovative
ideas to support the schools. Considering her love for ideas, and the school
colors (Green & White), I created this logo. In tandem with her campaign platform,
this logo was featured heavily on the campaign trail; including but not limited
to: yard signs, jumbo post cards, social media, bumper stickers, and flyers

## Web Design

Stacy wanted a website to share information about her campaign, provide
information on how to vote, and to showcase endorsements. In addition to this, 
I maintained her [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/stacybrickman4wbsd/)

## Flyers

West Bloomfield has a large senior citizen population, and thus a large absentee 
voter group. In order to inform voters of her experience and platform, Stacy and I 
collaborated to create this flyer. I was in charge of the design, and Stacy 
provided the type content. We used vistaprint to print these flyers, and voters
found them very informational.
