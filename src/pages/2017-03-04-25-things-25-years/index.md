1. Be better. Do better. Give back the best

2. Invest in yourself (interpret this as you will)

3. Be picky - especially when deciding how you invest your time

4. Ask for help. Don't waste too much time spinning your wheels.

5. Be honest about your interests, likes/dislikes

6. A picture might be worth 1000 words, but writing shit down lraves some pretty nostalgic crap. Also, take pictures of you & the people you are with. Years later you aren't going to give a damn about the ransom scenery. 

7. Do your homework. Don't go into an interview clueless.

8. Be careful who you trust - the easiest way to well...are you afraid to tell this person the truth? Are you afraid of what they'll think/judge you for it?

9. Be careful about what you write on the internet/emails

10. Keep learning - at minimum listen to audiobooks/podcasts & read online

11. Weight is just a number, like GPA. A stupid number that doesn't take into consideration so many other important factors.

12. Take credit for your work - don't let others use you.

13. Always question the decisions, actions and intentions of "authority figures"

14. Role models, like politicians are NOT perfect & therefore will disappoint you. It's like that song - [you should never meet your heroes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLNhzxoTJBQ).

15. Work (and school) isn't everything

16. Therapy helps. So does writing.

17. Don't be afraid to put yourself out there - having a web presence helps.

18. Friends will come and go. Make sure you keep the good ones close.

19. You can discuss their problems with them, but you can't make decisions for them.

20. You live in a time where you LITERALLY can't keep up with every Jones' out there. Comparison is the THEIF of JOY.

21. Take the time to reflect on what you want & communicate your wants affectively.

22. Don't be afraid to put the book down and/or stop watching a show. If you don't like it you don't have to read the next chapter.

23. Free samples & free things are the best

24. Semi-frequent at home spa days are a glorious necessity. Also, take care of your skin & hydrate

25. Side projects are supposed to be fun. If it's not fun, you better be learning something
