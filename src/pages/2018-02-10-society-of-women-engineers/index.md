Being an active member and leader in the Society of Women Engineers allowed me 
to exercise my creative muscle in the midst of all my technical classes. Since 
my freshman year, I was able to contribute several logos, print designs, and 
t-shirt design for various events and causes. If you walk around Ann Arbor MI, 
chances are, you'll see someone wearing a t-shirt I designed.

The banner above is still used on the [SWE Umich Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/sweumich/). 

## Peace, Love, SWE

This was one of the first designs I created for SWE. It was initially featured
on t-shirts for the 2011-2012 leadership corps, and now a colored version is 
featured on computer decal stickers. 

## Mr. Engineer 2012

During my sophmore year at University of Michigan, I was one of the College Relations
co-chairs. One of our main responsibilities was running the Mr. Engineer Charity 
Competition (currently known as the Engineering Games Charity Competition). All
proceeds of this event go to DAPCEP - the Detroit Area Pre-College Engineering Program. 
I designed this logo after my co-chair and I decided on the theme "Embrace Your Inner Geek."
This logo was featured on social media pages, and in print advertising. 

Our show featured a contestant that recited 100 digits of Pi (memorized), and a
contestant that kicked a field-goal on stage. 

## ASME/SWE Fun Run 2013

Every year, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the Society of Women Engineers 
groups at University of Michigan team up to host a 5k Fun Run benefitting Mott's 
Children's Hospital. In 2013, I had the opportunity to design a logo that would be 
featured on print, web and social media advertising, and on T-Shirts. 

## GREAT Day 2013

In 2013, SWE hosted the first annual GREAT Day - Girls Research Engineering and 
Technology Day. This outreach event was designed to inspire 6th-9th graders to 
pursue STEM fields -- particularly in Engineering and Technology. I designed this
logo to highlight the majors/degrees that were related to the activites the 
students would be completing that day. This logo was featured in print, and web 
advertising, and on T-Shirts.
